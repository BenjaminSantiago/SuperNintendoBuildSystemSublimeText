Super Nintendo Build System for Sublime Text
===================================

A build system for Sublime Text, allowing you to create SNES ROM images with the wla-dx compiler, and run them, with a simple keystroke.

Note that this only works with a single object (ie main.asm becomes main.o), and doesn't take into account .spc (sound) code.
